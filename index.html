                <h1>SODIUM SILICATE HYDRATES
                    & ANHYDROUS POWDERS</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The soluble silicates are water soluble glasses generally
                    manufactured from varied proportion to meet the needs of
                    different users , Included among these products are the sodium
                    which range from readily and highly soluble crystalline forms to
                    lumps and powders which are sparingly soluble, from slightly
                    sticky fluids to heavy viscous solutions which barely flow</p>
                <br>
                <p>For those preferring sodium silicates in the form of amorphous
                    powders a variety of products is included in the line , They
                    include both hydrated and anhydrous from which SiO2 , Na2O
                    ratios from 2.00 to 3.22.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Sodium silicate powders are desirable for a variety of reasons ,
                    as an integrated in dry blended detergents and specially cements,
                    to control interactions with other chemicals where liquids
                    compatibility may be a problem or where reactivity must be
                    delayed , for convenience in storage and handling or to avoid
                    freezing , or to increase the concentration of silicate solutions
                    beyond commercially available ranges. The chemical and
                    physical characteristics of the most commom soluble silicate
                    powders produced by are described in this bulletin , if you would
                    like further details on their properties or applications or
                    variations of these products to meet specially requirements ,

                <h1>SODIUM SILICATE POWDER</h1>
                <h2>Typical Properties & Use Of Sodium Silicate Powder</h2>
                <br>
                <p>1.The bondsil is nothing but an important substitude of
                    sodium silicate powder. it is a water soluble powder
                    manufactured from varied properties of an alkali metals &
                    SiO2. We made the various range of silicate products to meet
                    the need of difference users. They include both hydrated &
                    unhydrated forms with SiO2, Na2O ratios from 2.00 to 3.22.</p>
                <br>
                <p>2.Specially cements to control interaction with other chemicals
                    where liquid compatibility may be a problem or where
                    reactivity must be delayed, Also easy for storage, handling and
                    avoid freezing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>3.It is a fine white powder and has a ratio 3.2, as well as all the
                    other liquid silicates, when dissolves it forms a hazy, colourless
                    solution. Bondsil are used for several specialised Refractory
                    compounds, Detergents & Acid resistance cements. As acid
                    resistant, its binding strength is developed even if it does not
                    dissolved even if it does not dissolve completely after adding
                    water, such cements are proved very satisfactory in many
                    industrial applications, It is a fine white powder and has a ratio
                    3.2, as well all the other liquid silicates, when dissolved it forms
                    a hazy, colourless solution, Bondsil.</p>

            <div class="content3-left">
                <p>5. Bondsil-33 is also preferred for making acid resistant
                    Enamal frits. In making enamal frits the speed of reaction or
                    the rate of melting of powder depends on the particle size. Also
                    used as a binder in some cements & briqueting of various ares,
                    and other mineral products.</p>
                <br>
                <p>6. Bondsil-33 should not stand for more length of time in open
                    packages ar in containers that are not air-tight and water proof
                    contact with air may result in taking (due to moisture
                    absorption) and reduction of its lubility (due to absorption of
                    carbondioxide).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>7. Use of Bondsil In Refractory & Chemical Resistant Cements:
                    Used as binder where stability of resistance to chemicals is
                    required Silicate binder develops high green strength, by air
                    setting without heat. They also impart increased tire stength,
                    they are corrosive. They are easy and safe to handle. They
                    forms no fumes on fire hazards. They are very much useful in
                    refractories as refractory mortars and ramming Gunning,
                    Patching mixes in practically all refractory or chemical resis
                    tant construction and in their maintenance.</p>

                    furnaces. coke ovens, blast furnaces, open bearths, oxygen
                    converters, electornic steel furnaces, heat treating furnaces,
                    ladle linings, catalytic cracking chambers, sevage works,
                    cheminey construction, electrolytic cells, acid manufacturing

                <p>8. Sodium Silicate Powder (Alkaline Grade): Bondsil-22 Similar
                    in appearance as Bondsil-33 and has a ratio of 2.3. It disso. Ives
                    more quickly and easily comparing to Bondsil-33 due to its
                    higher alkalinity. In some cases because of its rapid dissolving
                    powder it is preferable where neutral grade powder dissolves
                    slowly. Wherever high alkali containt is required alkaline
                    grade is applicable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bondsil-22 is mainly used in specialised coatings and
                    refractory cem- ents. Bondsil-22 is useful as binders for dry
                    minerals. It can be utili- sed in cements with combination of
                    liquid silicate binder where it is de- sirable to increase the total
                    silicate solid containt without further incre- asing the velocity
                    of the compound.

                <p>9. Effects Of Silicate (Bondsil) Composition: (For Detergent) It
                    is extensively used in household and industrial detergent
                    powder all over Europe and America. This is a common
                    constituent of all the det ergent powder in Europs and America
                    when no detergent is allowed with phosphate. You can
                    eliminate the use of Tri Sodium Phosphate, Tri So dium Poly
                    Phosphate, Sodium Perborate and Geolite.</p>
